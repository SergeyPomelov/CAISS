![Computer and algorithm interaction simulation software (CAISS)](https://i.ibb.co/PD5B7By/web-performance-monitoring-101.jpg)

The simulation softwareâ€™s core contains representations of architecture and algorithm implemented atop of a mathematical model derived in a related Ph.D thesises. It is intended for simulation architecture and algorithm interactions and listing the results for optimization purposes. Besides, it includes a few benchmarks for comparison a real performance with simulation results for improving and testing purposes. 

### Running in IDEA
First - import the Gradle project. Then select the desired runnable 
class and run as a console Java application.
**benchmarks.ants.run.AntsRunner
benchmarks.matrixes.ManualBenchmarksRunner**

The next runnable needs a JMH plugin and annotations processing on.
**benchmarks.matrixes.JMHBenchmarksRunner** 

### Running via Gradle
gradle -jmh command runs the 
**benchmarks.matrixes.JMHBenchmarksRunner** 
without additional settings.
